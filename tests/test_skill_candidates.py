"""Skill-candidate advisory — "a skill might outperform a doc here".

Covers `_check_skill_candidates` in audit_agent_config, its default-off gate,
and the `skill_candidate` correction kind in suggest_corrections.

⚠ NON-VACUITY NOTE. The interesting assertions here are the NEGATIVE ones: that
file size alone never fires, that a package root is never reported as a subtree,
and that the advisory is silent on a default install. A test suite that only
proved "a concentrated section is found" would pass just as happily on a checker
that flagged every large section, which is the failure this feature was designed
against.

# Tuning corpus — named per the ROADMAP close condition.
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
#
# Thresholds were tuned 2026-08-06 against five real agent configs, none of them
# written for this feature and four of them outside the repo under test:
#
#   C:\MCPs\jcodemunch-mcp\CLAUDE.md   22,843 tok,  9 H2 sections, 779 files
#   C:\MCPs\jdocmunch-mcp\CLAUDE.md    11,491 tok, 24 H2 sections, 542 files
#   C:\MCPs\jdatamunch-mcp\CLAUDE.md   10,188 tok,  6 H2 sections, 161 files
#   C:\MCPs\jcodemunch-mcp\AGENTS.md    1,317 tok,  3 H2 sections, 779 files
#   C:\Users\j\.claude\CLAUDE.md          379 tok,  1 H2 section,  779 files
#
# At the shipped thresholds that corpus yields TWO findings:
#   - jdoc CLAUDE.md, a per-release section -> src/jdocmunch_mcp/tools
#     (0.67 concentration, 0.12 repo share, 739 tokens)
#   - jcm AGENTS.md "Session-Aware Routing" -> src/jcodemunch_mcp/tools
#     (0.67 concentration, 0.13 repo share, 625 tokens)
#
# ⚠ The second is a KNOWN WEAK POSITIVE and is recorded here rather than tuned
# away. It is global routing guidance; it scores as concentrated because the
# tool names it cites resolve to the files that implement those tools. Any
# config that names the tools it tells an agent to call has this shape. Two
# findings is not a precision measurement and must not be quoted as one.
#
# ⚠ jcm's own CLAUDE.md yields ZERO findings, including its "Current State"
# section. That section IS bloat (~7k tokens) and `_check_bloat` flags it, but
# its references span the whole package, so it is not scope-concentrated. The
# roadmap entry originally cited it as the dogfood case; measuring falsified
# that. Do not reinstate the claim without re-measuring.
