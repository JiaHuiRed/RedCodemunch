"""The ranking ledger stops claiming a channel that never ran (v1.108.186).

``_get_ranked_context_fusion`` recorded ``semantic_used=True`` on every row while
building only the lexical, identity and structural channels. Its own
``_meta.channels`` listed the three, and from v1.108.185 its verdict reported
``channels.semantic: "off"`` — so the response and the ledger disagreed about the
same call, and the ledger was the one that was wrong.

**Why this got its own release rather than a one-line edit.** ``WeightTuner``
learns a per-repo ``semantic_weight`` by splitting ledger rows on that column and
comparing mean confidence between the groups. Flipping the flag fixes new rows and
leaves the old ones steering a learned parameter for the whole 90-day recency
window, so the ledger would hold two labels for one operation. Reproduced before
fixing: the mislabelled rows walked ``semantic_weight`` from 0.5 to 0.45 on a
ledger where the honest labels decline to move it at all.

**The historical rows are excluded, not rewritten, and not counted as off.** Those
rows carry ``tool = "get_ranked_context_fusion"``, a value no other producer
writes, so they are exactly identifiable with no heuristic. A one-time corrective
UPDATE was rejected: the tuner has only ever written the ``tuning.jsonc`` sidecar
and ``suggest_corrections`` is read-only by charter, so rewriting a user's
telemetry rows is a charter change, not an implementation detail. Leaving them to
age out was also rejected, because that is learning from a corpus we know is
mislabelled. They become a THIRD answer — ``events_semantic_label_unknown`` —
disclosed by every consumer that reads the column.

Helper names are prefixed ``_r186``; a plain ``_state`` helper once outranked
``token_tracker._State`` for a golden replay query and cost a red CI run.
