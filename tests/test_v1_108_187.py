"""Both fusion exits record the ledger features they were measuring (v1.108.187).

1.108.186 fixed the `semantic_used` column on `_get_ranked_context_fusion` and
reported two adjacent gaps rather than folding them in. This is the first of them.

That exit passed no `extract_ledger_features` payload at all, so `top1_score`,
`top2_score` and `identity_hit` were recorded as their defaults on every row it ever
wrote — and three of regret's six signals read those columns. `search_symbols_fusion`
had the narrower half of the same defect: it passed the features but built their input
without an `identity` key, so `identity_hit` was False there too regardless of what
the identity channel found. Both fusion producers are fixed here, because shipping one
honest and one false would have guaranteed a third release on the same field.

**The two halves are NOT equally repairable, and that asymmetry is the point.** For
get_ranked_context the pre-fix rows are exactly identifiable — a row that returned
symbols while recording no `top1_score` can only have come from the exit that passed
no features. For `search_symbols_fusion` there is no such discriminator: pre-fix
`identity_hit` is always 0, and 0 is also an honest post-fix answer. No version or
timestamp column exists to bound it by, so its history is unseparable and the recency
window is the only remedy. A heuristic there would be worse than the gap.

Helper names are prefixed ``_r187``; the replay fixture queries
``build_identity_channel``, ``attach_confidence`` and ``_State``, so no helper here
carries any of those names.
