"""Retrieval counterfactuals — why was this action not proposed?

The load-bearing test is ``TestFidelity``. An explanation that disagrees with
what ``route`` actually did is worse than no explanation: it sends a reader to
tune a stage that was never consulted. So the reconstruction is checked against
``classify_intent`` + ``search_catalog`` on **every** benchmark query, hits and
misses alike, rather than being spot-checked on the interesting ones.
